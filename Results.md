# Results

After a successful simulation, you can display several simulated measured values in a graphical representation. Currently, graphs are offered for the following values:

  * Simulated zone air temperature
  * Simulated zone CO2-concentration
  * Simulated zone relative humidity
  * Simulated outdoor temperature
  * Simulated outdoor air pressure 
  * Window openings
  * Occupancy

As soon as you open the results page (View Results) you get a selection screen, on which you have several setting options. We offer you the option to to design the graphs according to your needs. You can select the following:

  * Graph with one or two measured values displayed
     * First measured value is plotted on the Y-axis 1
     * Second measured value is plotted on Y-axis 2
  * Individual colors for each plotted measured value
  * Individual labels for each plotted measured value
  * Individual title for the plotted graph
