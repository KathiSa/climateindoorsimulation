# Program Features

This web application provides the user with the following functionality:

   * Simulation configuration
      * Upload of an IDF file
      * Upload of an EPW file
      * Selection of the simulation period (Timeframe)
         * Simulation over then span of one day
         * Simulation over the span of several days up to a year
      * Upload of an occupancy CSV file or creating a custom occupancy
      * Adjustment of room parameters (room dimensions and infiltration rate)
   * Running the simulation
   * Running a simulation only with an IDF and EPW file without further adjustments
