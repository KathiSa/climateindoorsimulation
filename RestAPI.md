# Rest API

The Rest API is accessible directly by placing an HTTP request. By using a Jupyter Notebook, for example, a simulation can be started programmatically for further individuality. The input data and results of simulations can also be viewed. It is also possible to create a own simulation series with different input-, weather-, and occupancy files with diverse room parameters. With the Rest API it is also possible to automate simulations with an own script. The following pages give first a descriptions and examples on the available endpoints. The second page shows an example notebook with possible requests. This example notebook is also available for download.
