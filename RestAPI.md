# Rest API

The Rest API is accessible directly by placing an HTTP request. By using a Jupyter Notebook, for example, a simulation can be started programmatically for further individuality. A own simulation series with different input-, weather-, and occupancyfiles on top the existing simulation series with the editable parameters can be created. With the Rest API it is also possible to automate simulations with an own script.
