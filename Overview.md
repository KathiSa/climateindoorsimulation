# Overview

TODO: PICTURE 

If you are satisfied with the input data, you can now start the simulation. To do this, click on the "Start Simulation" field (Fig. Overview, marker 4). Once you have done this, the simulation ID will be displayed at the top, allowing you to clearly distinguish between the different simulations (Fig. Overview, marker 1). Within the next few seconds, you will now be continuously informed about the progress of the simulation.

In order for EnergyPlus to run the simulation with the data you have provided, the first step is to transfer the data from the frontend (GUI) to the backend. This happens automatically and you will be informed in real time about the data packages transferred in sequence, such as the idf or epw file (Fig. Overview, marker 2). Once this is done, Energyplus will start the execution of the simulation and you will be shown a loading circle while the simulation is running.

After the simulation has been run successfully, you will receive a "simulation finished" success message. The "View Results" Button will take you to the next step of the web application where you can plot the results of the simulation (Fig.Overview, marker 5) and download the complete results as a csv-file or eso-file.
