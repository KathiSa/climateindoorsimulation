# Simulation History

In the simulation history you can get an overview of the simulations performed so far. In the Table the simulation history the individual simulation ID and the creation date of the individual simulations are displayed. Furthermore you can see the status of the simulation.

You can return to the start page of the program either via the logo in the upper right corner or via the button "Return to Home" (below the displayed table) to return to the start page. If you want to go to the previous step, you can use the "Back" button.
